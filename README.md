Context Aware Fraud Detection using advanced analytics to protect against fraud

Today context-aware computing is quickly becoming the number one priority of most companies in order to connect better with their customers. Context-aware computing is customizing the content of the product or service according to the user’s context i.e. using the user’s location, social media contributions, preferences, etc. to customize the service in way that it caters to the user’s needs. Basically it uses all these factors to create proactive services according to the user’s location and situation.
Context-aware computing however has made the user very susceptible to online fraud. Since the user is basically placing his trust in the service providers, it makes him vulnerable to fraud where his personal data can be misused. Today every user wants to access his systems from various devices and locations. Hence there is no fixed IP or specific device for his transactions which makes it difficult for firewalls to block access. Also the user no longer owns the applications that store and use his data. In the event of this virtualization, it is difficult to determine whether the action taken by the user’s device is fraudulent or not. 
The project uses the location, financial details and other aspects of the user to detect if transactions done from a user’s device are valid or not. Basically the project will employ machine learning to find patterns in the data that do not conform to the normal behavior of the user. This kind of anomaly detection will make it easier to pinpoint context-aware fraud ensuring the security of the user’s data.
